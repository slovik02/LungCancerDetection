# LungCancerDetection
Detecting different types of lung cancer using image processing and machine learning.

# Project description
This project is about chest cancer detection using machine learning. Kaggle Chest CT-Scan images Dataset was used. Data contain 3 chest cancer types which are Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 folder for the normal cell.

Project's plan:

Preprocessing images (presenting sample and number of images, preprocessing image brightness and size);
Creating a dataframe;
Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, PCA);
Creating models (KNN, Random Forest, SVC);
Applying ensembles methods (Voting classifier and Stacking classifier).
